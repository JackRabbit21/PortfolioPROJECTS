Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction (AIBL Baseline Data)

This project uses the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) diagnosis at baseline using tabular features (demographics, APOE genotype, and neuropsychological test scores).
